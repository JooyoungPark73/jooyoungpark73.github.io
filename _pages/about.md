I am a Ph.D. Student in the School of Comptuer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University, advised by [Prof. Dmitrii Ustiugov](https://ustiugov.github.io/). My research interest is Cloud Architecture, Serverless Computing, and Systems for Machine Learning.

Before joining NTU Singapore, I received B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Korea University at South Korea. I was advised by [Prof. Jong-Kook Kim](https://hpic.korea.ac.kr/), and my research focus was Machine Learning Systems.
