I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the HyScale Lab in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, under the guidance of Professor [Dmitrii Ustiugov](https://ustiugov.github.io/). 

Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Korea University, South Korea, under the guidance of Professor [Jong-Kook Kim](https://hpic.korea.ac.kr/). During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research assistant at [HPIC](https://hpic.korea.ac.kr/) where I contributed to several machine learning projects.

My area of expertise and interest lies in computer systems and architecture, with a particular focus on designing efficient and scalable cloud systems, serverless architectures, and machine learning support. Additionally, I have a background in operating systems, computer architecture design, FPGAs, compilers, and analog circuits.
